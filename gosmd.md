### 1. Consecrated Mind chase

- Explain tether mechanic: shoot the box, form a line of guardians to the cross
- Tether will be used to open doors in this encounter
- There will be three rooms to go through
- In each room the boss will have to be taken care of, so we split into three teams of two and every team grabs one room
- Kill everybody until an Angelic hydra appears, kill it and find a box to tether and progress as far as you can
- If it is your designated room, survive and pay a lot of attention to the boss
- Pick up those glowing cubes as soon as the boss drops them, otherwise we all wipe
- You can't pick up any more cubes for two and half minutes after you did it once
- I mean you totally can, but you will also die in the process

### 1.1. DIV puzzles after the first encounter

- Do DIV puzzle number 2 right at the end of the first encounter
- Do DIV puzzle number 3 in that jumping area

### 2. Conflux defence

- We have a diamond-shaped map with 4 confluxes on its corners
- We'll have four players to defend confluxes and other two players to assist them
- To place defenders at their confluxes, we'll go together with the whole team clockwise, dropping off defenders and assistants in the process
- Using you designated assistant (runner), tether from the conflux to the cross every 40 seconds to get "Enlightened" buff back to be able to destroy white vex shields.
- One Enlightened bullet is enough to destroy those shields
- At some random point you'll get three Hydras, ask your runner to help you and try your best to survive and kill them all
- As soon as all four confluxes have their Hydras defeated, we'll go in the middle and finish the encounter in a similar way

### 3. Consecrated Mind

- Gambit team and Eyes team, three players each
- Gambit team: you'll have minotaurs, each drops 5 gambit motes upon death
- One of the corner confluxes will be very visibly glowing, and that is where the first minotaur will appear
- You need to collect 30 motes in total and deposit them in that glowing conflux in order to start DPS phase
- Player 1 will collect 5 motes and run to the conflux asap, as it will be attacked by vex with the same white shields soon
- Players 2 will kill 2 minotaurs in that time and go deposit them, player 3 should do the same after that
- Player 1 will return and collect those last 5 motes and start DPS phase
- Eyes team: watch after the boss and follow it when it goes away to the edge of the map
- One player should then pick up the cube and look at the boss
- The boss will have two sets of eyes: outer and inner. Only one of them will light up when the boss stops moving its wings. You should call out outer ot inner, and destroy one glowing eye on the middle wing. Your teammates will destroy the other two eyes
- Since you can't pick up any cubes anymore, you will rotate that role between you
- Space yourselves before picking up the cube, it will kill everyone standing too close
- Stay away from minotaurs to avoid stealing motes from gambit team
- DPS phase: shoot all the glowing red eyes, and put as much damage as possible in that white crit spot in the middle. Divinity bubble will make it easier to hit

### 3.1. DIV puzzles after the third encounter

- Puzzle 4 and Puzzle 5 are in the same area in the middle
- Puzzle 6 and Puzzle 7 are behind a waterfall

### 4. Sanctified Mind

- Teams: Gambit 1, Gambit 2, Builders, two players each
- We'll have a blue conflux somewhere on the left side and an orange conflux on the right side
- The objective is to fill them both with 30 motes each, which will allow us to begin a DPS phase
- The boss has red crit spots, on left and right. You can destroy them to open a portal to the corresponding island with enemies and motes
- We begin from the left side
- Gambit 1 enters, kill every single enemy and collect every single mote, they will be marked on you mini map. As soon as you don't have enemies or mote markers on you radar, ask other players to PULL you back
- Those players will shoot that same crit spot and will pull Gambit 1 back
- Additionally, it will also open a portal on that island again. Gambit 2 should jump in and do the same: kill everyone, collect every mote, ask other to PULL
- Those motes you deposit in the left conflux, which gives you Enlightened again. With it, focus on removing white shields from enemies, and other players will finish them.
- Repeat the same process on the right side to fill the right orange conflux
- Builder team: each time a portal opens, the boss will remove one piece of the middle platform we are standing on
- Each piece have a corresponding cross. Tether from any working conflux to that cross to build that piece back
- SHERPA NOTE: Don't bother with 3-player builds at all, focus on easy 2-player builds
- Builder team should only call out "Building left/ Building right", and other players must stay away from that side to avoid fucking up their tether strings
- When both confluxes will be filled, defeat an Angelic Hydra, tether from the blue/orange conflux to the glowing cross in the middle, depending on the color of that cross
- DPS in its crit spot, OR div puzzle below the boss
